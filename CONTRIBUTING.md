# Improvement Ideas

There's a list of feature I will eventually add one day or another.

- Base rendered video lengths on the configuration video length instead of the number of frames received, in order to have consistent video lengths in case of frames not received;

- Use in memory base64 string instead of saving the png frames;

- Use WebRTC on clients which supports it;
